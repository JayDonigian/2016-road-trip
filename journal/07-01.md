## Journal Entry

* Showered! $0.25/3.5 minutes. It was a little confusing and a long walk, but it felt good to be clean. Jay's shower was but a trickle. 😕
  * Jay: first shower since Sunday evening
  * Mel: first shower since Monday morning
* Ate eggs + mushies + peps + *BEER*.
* Packed up camp. It was **WARM**. 🥵
* We left the campsite on the ferry, thinking we had made the strict 11am checkout time. We realized a short while later that we had been living an hour behind. Apparently, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are an hour ahead of Boston! LOLOLOLOL 😂
* We then drove to downtown St. John. It was crazy busy with activities. That's when we realized it was Canada day! We ditched downtown because there was nowhere to park. 
* Checked out the Reversing Falls/Rapids. It was slack tide, so it was fairly calm.
  * 200' underwater waterfall!
  * 14' difference between the St. John river and the Bay of Fundy. This is what causes the Falls/Rapids.
  * $6.50
* Went to Tim's (aka Tim Hortons) for the first time.
  * Got an ice cap (iced cappuccino). #SoCanada. It was basically a coffee coolata. They made Jay's belly hurt. 😖
  * Charged our laptop and phones.
  * Booked lodging for Sunday through Wednesday @ Valley View park.
  * Got directions, etc.
* Left St. John, stopped at an Irving Big Stop for gas. Card struggles. For some reason we counted the gas against our budget. It was early, we were still figuring things out.
* Stopped at the Fundy overlook. Our first glimpse!
* Drove to The Shire (**free!** camping in New Horton).
* We set up camp and were immediately confronted by a woman whose Scottish husband was passed out on a bench swing. She asked if we were the owners or something. So weird.
* Me Don, the owner, who popped over on his 4-wheeler. He's a great guy who loves meeting people.
* Met Bob Smith, a guy from Hillsborough who was staying at The Shire with his wife, Patty, in a camper. They were fishing with their friends, including the drunk Scot.
* The Shire had a wood burning pizza oven! Free wood, a fire pit, a garden and a tin man.
* We met Justin (Quebec) and Amara (Saskatchewan / Nova Scotia), a hippy-ish couple.
* Took a trip to the general store for more beer and a frozen pizza. $23
  *  We cooked the frozen pizza in the wood-burning pizza oven. It was not very effective. 🔥🍕
* Hung out and drank beers and some of Bob's homemade hooch.
* The weird girl (Scotch daughter) wanted to play a CSI board game. No one else did.
* We learned how to play washer toss, which is basically Canadian corn hole.
* Met and hung out with Don's friends from down the street: Jacques and his wife. They've travelled a lot! Jacques is a professor.
* We met Jordan, the leader of a church group from Saskatchewan.
* Hung out by the fire drinking beer and hooch.
  * Tried Moose Light beer!
  * Hung out with Patty, Bob, Justin, Jordan, Georgina
* Passed out. 😴💤
* 🌙
* **HOLY FUCK MOSQUITOES EVERYWHERE!**
* 🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟
