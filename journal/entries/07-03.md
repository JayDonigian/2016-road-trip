## Journal Entry

* Breakfast: black coffee, yogurt + cocoa / coconut granola
* Went for a walk closer to the shore to check out the Five Islands.
* Then we broke down camp. SO WINDY. 💨
* We drove to Parrsboro for gas. It's a super cute town.
* We then got headed in the right direction and went to the fish market across from the campground. We got a great deal on fish! Bought a pound of haddock and a bag of ice for $8!
* Our next stop was That Dutchman's Cheese Farm. It was a cool farm up on a hill with lots of animals to see and hang out with. Great views! We tried many kinds of gouda! **TASTY.**
  * Mel's favorite: Jalapeno and Medium Gouda
  * Jay's Favorite: Really Old Growler + Cumin
  * Bought a brick of medium and some spreadable jalapeno for $13.
* Tried to stop at a bike store in Truro, but it was closed.
* After Truro, we started on the long leg of the journey to Valley View Provincial Park in Bridgetown. It was a boring drive. There weren't many cool license plates and there were lots of tailgaters. The radio DJ was weird: he was very excited about a power outage.
* We got to our campsite ($23). It was super quiet. The front office had Wi-Fi! They also delivered wood! Unfortunately, because of the holiday weekend there was no booze allowed until July 5th.
* We set up camp, including our hammocks for the first time! Awesome sauce. We hung our (still) damp laundry on a laundry line.
* We found two ticks! 😬
* Later, we went for a walk to the scenic "look off" to view the valley. Then we walked around the campground and park.
* Our site is on the top of the hill, near the camp manager, but all the other campers are hanging out in their cars. ☹️
* Hung out for a bit. Journaled. Started a fire and started prepping dinner, but the camp manager came by and told us we couldn't have a fire because of the dry conditions and high winds. We added a few more pieces of wood to the fire, so we could quickly cook our meal, and then we doused it.
* Dinner: foil packets with haddock, zucchini, onion, purple potatoes, lemon, garlic, summer seasoning (Thanks Patty Smith!), butter, etc. It was **DELISH!!!**.
* Cleaned up. Boiled H2O because there was a boil water order! 😐
