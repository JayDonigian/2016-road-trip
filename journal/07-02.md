## Journal Entry

* Woke up at ~5 AM to FUCKING MOSQUITO HELL! Pure carnage. Blood everywhere. Bug corpses littered the camper. There was blood on our clothes. Gross.
* Jay was also horrible hungover from the hooch.
* The mosquitoes were finally driven out when it started pouring... Not ideal for packing up.
* We packed up our wet stuff after a little more sleep and GTFO'd after a few quick goodbyes.
* Stopped at Hopewell Rocks, but admission was $10 each, and it was high tide. A sign told us low tide was better for viewing. We decided we might try again when leaving Nova Scotia.
* We stopped at an Irving to pee.
* Drove to downtown Moncton. Got some breakfast sammies + cappuccinos with a gift card to Starbucks.
* Welcome to Nova Scotia!!!
* The Welcome Center was super windy (there was a wind farm), but it was really nice. The bathrooms were super clean. There was lots of helpful information and also a weird, ferret-like velociraptor statue. 🦖
* Drove to the campground at Five Islands. Super nice people! Stunning vista. Great views of the five islands. We found a nice spot under a tree. Did some laundry but the dryer shut off before the laundry was dry.
* We then went to Truro to get some supplies. We went grocery shopping at Soobey's and found a life-changing, battery-powered mattress pump at Walmart ($35).
* We also picked up some Canadian cash ($30).
* On the way back to the campsite, we picked up two bags of wood from a road-side stand ($6).
* When we got back to our campsite, the laundry still wasn't dry. We hung it up all around the tent using the lines for the awning.
* Made dinner: mango jalapeno chicken sausages with baked beans. Yum!
* Sleep.
